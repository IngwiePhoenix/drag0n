# Drag0n Installer

This is an application, based on (AppJS)[https://github.com/appjs/appjs] and the (Yii framework)[http://www.yiiframework.com].
It uses HTML/JS/CSS to maintain its frontend and uses PHP to manage the installation and backend.

## Currently in development...
This is just a pre-alpha version. When you pull it, just run the .app like you'd run any other mac application. You won't be able to do much...but rather be able to studdy the code it inherits.
