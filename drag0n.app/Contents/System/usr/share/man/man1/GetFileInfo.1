.It Fl t 
Gets the file type, a string of exactly four characters.  If the type is not set, these will display as an empty pair of quotation marks.  Directories do not have types, so the type will be skipped if all information is being displayed; specifying -t for a directory is an error.
.It Fl c
Gets the file's creator, a string of four characters enclosed in quotation marks.  If the creator is not set, these will display as an empty pair of quotation marks.  Directories do not have creators, so the creator will be skipped if all information is being displayed; specifying -c for a directory is an error.
.It Fl d
