.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBxcrun\fP [\-\-sdk <SDK name>] \-\-find <tool name>
.sp
\fBxcrun\fP [\-\-sdk <SDK name>] <tool name> ... tool arguments ...
.sp
\fB<tool name>\fP ... tool arguments ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBxcrun\fP provides a means to locate or invoke developer tools from the
command\-line, without requiring users to modify Makefiles or otherwise take
inconvenient measures to support multiple Xcode tool chains.
.sp
The tool \fBxcode\-select(1)\fP is used to set a system default for the
active developer directory, and may be overridden by the DEVELOPER_DIR
environment variable (see \fI\%ENVIRONMENT\fP).
.sp
The SDK which will be searched defaults to the boot system OS SDK, and can be
specified by the SDKROOT environment variable or the \fI\%--sdk\fP option
(which takes precedences over SDKROOT). When used to invoke another tool (as
opposed to simply finding it), \fBxcrun\fP will provide the absolute path
to the selected SDK in the SDKROOT environment variable. See \fI\%ENVIRONMENT\fP
for more information.
.SS Usage
.sp
\fBxcrun\fP supports several different usages, to both look up the paths to
tools as well as execute them.
.sp
When used with the \fI\-\-find\fP argument, as in \fBxcrun [\-\-sdk <SDK
name>] \-\-find <tool name>\fP, the absolute path to the tool (in the provided SDK,
if given) will be printed.
.sp
When used without \fI\-\-find\fP, the name of a tool is required and the tool
will be executed with the provided arguments.
.sp
When used as the target of a symbolic link, it derives the tool name to use from
the name it was invoked under, and then executes that tool.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Add verbose information on how the tool lookup is performed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no\-cache
Don\(aqt consult the cache when looking up values. In effect, causes the cache
entry to be refreshed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-kill\-cache
Removes the cache. Causes all values to be re\-cached.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-sdk
Specifies which SDK to search for tools. If no \fI\%--sdk\fP argument is
provided, then the SDK used will be taken from the SDKROOT environment
variable, if present.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-toolchain
Specifies which toolchain to use to perform the lookup. If no
option:\fI\-\-toolchain\fP argument is provided, then the toolchain to use will be
taken from the TOOLCHAINS environment variable, if present.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-log
Print the full command line that is invoked.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-find
Enable "find" mode, in which the resolved tool path is printed instead of
the tool being executed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-run
Enable "run" mode, in which the resolved tool path is executed with any
provided additional arguments. This is the default mode.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-show\-sdk\-path
Print the path to the selected SDK.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-show\-sdk\-version
Print the version number of the selected SDK.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-show\-sdk\-platform\-path
Print the path to the platform for the selected SDK.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-show\-sdk\-platform\-version
Print the version number of the platform for the selected SDK.
.UNINDENT
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.sp
DEVELOPER_DIR
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Overrides the active developer directory. When DEVELOPER_DIR is set, its value
will be used instead of the system\-wide active developer directory.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
SDKROOT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the default SDK to be used when looking up tools (some tools may have
SDK specific versions).
.sp
This environment variable is also \fBset\fP by \fBxcrun\fP to be the
absolute path to the user provided SDK (either via SDKROOT or the
\fI\%--sdk\fP option), when it is used to invoke a normal developer tool
(build tools like \fBxcodebuild\fP or \fBmake\fP are exempt from this
behavior).
.sp
For example, if \fBxcrun\fP is used to invoke \fBclang\fP via:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBxcrun \-\-sdk macosx clang test.c\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
then \fBxcrun\fP will provide the full path to the \fBmacosx\fP SDK in the
environment variable SDKROOT. That in turn will be used by \fBclang(1)\fP
to automatically select that SDK when compiling the \fBtest.c\fP file.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
TOOLCHAINS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Specifies the default toolchain to be used when looking up tools (for tools
which are toolchain specific).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
xcrun_log
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Same as specifying \-\-log.
.UNINDENT

.sp
xcrun_nocache
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Same as specifying \-\-no\-cache.
.UNINDENT

xcrun_verbose
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Same as specifying \-\-verbose.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
\fBxcrun \-\-find clang\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Finds the path to the \fBclang\fP binary in the default SDK.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBxcrun \-\-sdk iphoneos \-\-find texturetool\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Finds the path to the \fBtexturetool\fP binary in the iOS SDK.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBxcrun \-\-sdk macosx \-\-show\-sdk\-path\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Prints the path to the current Mac OS X SDK.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBxcrun git status\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Locates the \fBgit\fP command and then executes it with a single argument
(\fI"status"\fP).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.sp
When \fBxcrun\fP is invoked with the name \fBxcrun\fP, the options
\fI\-\-log\fP and \fI\-\-verbose\fP are useful debugging aids. The option
\fI\-\-no\-cache\fP can be used to bypass cache lookup, but often at a
significant cost in performance.
.sp
When \fBxcrun\fP has taken the place of another tool, the arguments are
those of the tool replaced, and the various \fBxcrun\fP options can\(aqt be
used. In this case, use the specific environment variables instead.
