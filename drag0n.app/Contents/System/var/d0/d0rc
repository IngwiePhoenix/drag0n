# drag0n default configuration
# Big subject to be chaned. But its used by the GUI, CLI, and URI - as well as the .build and .dev tools.

    # If you are a developer, set this to true.
    developer: yes
    # Disable or enable debugging

    display developer tools: yes
   
# The Deskshell based interface uses this 
GUI:
    # Use fullscreen upon launch (not implemented yet)
    use fullscreen: yes
    # Update resources upon launch
    instant update: yes
    # Only start searching when hitting return while in the search field. By default, it will search after each keypress.
    instant search: yes
    
# Only the command line uses these
CLI:
    # Enable the ncurses-based interface. (Not implemented, will be only experimental)
    ncurses: false
    # Display executed commands
    show cmd: true
    # Display output of commands (such as configure).
    # Developers can override this setting, if they need to display information in the terminal.

    # Expose clang if it's inside the bundle

    # Set PREFIX to drag0n.app/Contents/System/usr/local instead? Useful if you're rebuilding some developer tools - they are stored in usr/local.
    add prefix: false
    # ID of the build tools
    build toolkit id: d0.dev.buildtools

# The developer toolkit uses this
.dev:
    # Use one folder for all resources. If false, --outdir must be specified, and if even that isn't given, we use the current folder.
